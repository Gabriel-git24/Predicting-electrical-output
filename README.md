# Electrical Power Prediction Using Regression Models
This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict electrical power output based on input features. The primary focus is on comparing linear and polynomial regression models to identify the most accurate approach.

## Project Workflow:
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: Utilized Pandas to load and clean the dataset, ensuring it was ready for analysis.
   
2. Model Development: Built linear and polynomial regression models using **Scikit-learn**. Evaluated the models using R² scores to determine performance.
  
3. Visualization: Used **Matplotlib** to plot data trends, model predictions, and comparisons.

## Key Insights:
The polynomial regression model achieved a slightly higher R² score, indicating better performance compared to the linear regression model.

This project highlights the importance of model selection in achieving accurate predictions for real-world applications.
